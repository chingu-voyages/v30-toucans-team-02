This project was built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript following a MVC approach. It uses the Fetch API (async/await) to query the Google Books API to pull search results.

## Features

* Search by book title or author
* Display search results in grid view (using CSS grid)
* Additional functionality allows users to add books to a wishlist (saved via localStorage in the browser)
* Users can also click the "i" button to display a modal popup that includes the book's description and the ability to be redirected to an external search to purchase the book.
* The Google Books API key used in production is obscured using [Netlify serverless functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/).
